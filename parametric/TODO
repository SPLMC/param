- stochastic weak bisimulation
- collect special cases for analyses that is, cases where one would
  divide by zero
- improve DOT output
- rewards
  - expected instantaneous
  - expected accumulated
  (should both be simple, but must change lumping!)
- limit state exploration for bounded until
- method to set variables via command line
  (avoid for example having several BRP models)
- make switch for 'verbose' have an effect
- MDP support
  (bounded reachabiliy)
- steady-state analyses
